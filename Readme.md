zORg's WPF Startup Project
--------------------------

This project was created to aid in starting a new project with completely customized window style. You'll have only what you've created.

![Preview](preview.png)

It's now pretty outdated though. I'll add my new stydies when my current project will be closer to be finished so I'll put the best of it here.

* **zLib**

  Contains Classes that might be used throughout all the solution.

* **EffectLibrary**

  As the name says it's an effect Library. This thing is a CopyPaste from [Greg Schechter's tutorial on Effects][1]. Here is a [Build task][2] used in this project. I couldn't recreate this project (and keep BuildTask working), so I've just copied it.

* **ViewModel**

  Simply your ViewModel Dll. This way it will be separated from View in a right manner.

* **View**

  Here all UI related things go.
